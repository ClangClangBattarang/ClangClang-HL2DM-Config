This is collection of keybindings and fixes intended to make playing Half-Life 2: Deathmatch easier.

Currently is a work in progress, so I don't recommend using it for now.

# Instructions
1. On this page, left click on the *green* "Code" button, then click on "Download Zip".
2. Click and drag the "Half Life 2 Deathmatch" folder to your <steam library folder>/steamapps/common/ directory.

# List of current fixes
* Red screen flash is heavily reduced
* Model changer fix
* SteamVR fix
