// Anti-Community Patch for HL2DM Community Patch 10/10/21
// This reverts all optimised settings to the game's defaults. This is intended to be used for modding and mapping, as this enables some vanity features like swaying trees and re-adds vanilla rope behaviour.
//
// This is best used as an additional launch option for HL2DM (+exec community_patch_disabler.cfg) alongside other launch options you've added (e.g. +developer 2)
