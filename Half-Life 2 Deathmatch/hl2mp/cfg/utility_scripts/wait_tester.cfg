// Wait-Tester script
// From TF2 Wiki: https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Scripting#Wait-testing:
//
// "Since the wait command is integral to some scripts, it may be necessary to test to see if a server has disabled the command.
// This script relies on the fact that if the wait command is disabled on a server, the alias named wait can be defined by the user. Thus, the script creates an alias named waitTest which by default points to waitPositive, but if wait is not allowed (and can thus be defined by the user), will be redirected to waitNegative."

alias waitTester "alias waitTest waitPositive;wait;waitTest"
alias wait "alias waitTest waitNegative"
alias waitPositive "echo Wait is enabled on this server.;exec waitPositive.cfg"
alias waitNegative "echo Wait is DISABLED on this server!;exec waitNegative.cfg"
